# Clicking Game

## Description
The Clicking Game is a fun, interactive web application designed to entertain users through a simple clicking mechanism. Users can click to accumulate points, purchase auto-clickers for passive point generation, and buy multipliers to increase their scoring rate. The game also features real-time score tracking and a shop menu for upgrades.

## Features
- Manual Clicking: Directly click to earn points.
- Auto Clickers: Automatically generate points over time.
- Multiplier: Enhance your point accumulation rate.
- Real-time Score Display: View current score, auto-clickers count, multiplier level, and clicks per second (CPS).

## Getting Started
To play the Clicking Game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game does not require installation and runs directly in the browser.

## Assets
All game assets, including images, stylesheets, and scripts, are hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS). These assets are essential for the game's functionality and are not included in this GitHub repository.

## Contributions
While the HTML structure is shared here, the core JavaScript logic (`main.js` and `socket.js`) is kept private and hosted separately. Contributions to the project are welcome, but please note that modifications to the game's mechanics would require access to these private files.
